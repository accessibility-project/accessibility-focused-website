# ACCESSIBILITY-FOCUSED WEBSITE (NEWSPAGE)

## Project Overview
This project is part of my thesis, *"A Comparative Study of Standard UI/UX Design and Accessibility-Focused Approaches: User Experience and Usability Analysis."*

The goal is to replicate a newspaper website and then implement accessibility guidelines based on the **European Accessibility Act (EAA)**.

The original version, which does not follow accessibility guidelines, can be found here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mayaaedlund/website).

## Accessibility Guidelines Implemented
The following improvements will be made to ensure the website meets accessibility standards:

- **Color Contrast**: The contrast ratio between text and background will be at least **7:1** to improve readability for visually impaired users.
- **Scalable Text**: Users will be able to resize text without loss of functionality or readability.
- **Alternative Text (Alt-Text)**: All images and non-text elements will include descriptive alt attributes.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: The website will be fully operable without a mouse, ensuring that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard inputs.
- **Navigation Assistance**: Clear links, menus, and a *"Skip to Content"* function will be implemented to improve usability.

## Technologies

- React (Frontend framework)
- CSS (Styling)
- Accessibility best practices
